#variables
Creating web apps,games and search engines all involve storing and working with different types of data. They do so using variables. A variable stores a place of data, and gives it a specific name.

my_variable = 10

#boolean
A boolean is like a light switch. It can only have two values. Just like a light switch can only be on or off, a boolean can only be True or False.

my_int = 7

my_float = 1.23

my_bool = True

#reassigning
You can change the value of a variable by "reassigning" it, like this:

my_int = 7

-Change the value of my_int to 3

my_int =3

# Here's some code that will print my_int to the console:

print my_int

#Whitespace

In Python, whitespace is used to structure code. Whitespace is important, so you have to be careful with how you use it.

    eggs = 12
    return eggs
        
print spam()

#commenting
The # sign is for comments. A comment is a line of text that Python won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read.
