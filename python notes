#variables
Creating web apps,games and search engines all involve storing and working with different types of data. They do so using variables. A variable stores a place of data, and gives it a specific name.

my_variable = 10

#boolean
A boolean is like a light switch. It can only have two values. Just like a light switch can only be on or off, a boolean can only be True or False.

my_int = 7

my_float = 1.23

my_bool = True

#reassigning
You can change the value of a variable by "reassigning" it, like this:

my_int = 7

-Change the value of my_int to 3

my_int =3

# Here's some code that will print my_int to the console:

print my_int

#Whitespace

In Python, whitespace is used to structure code. Whitespace is important, so you have to be careful with how you use it.

def spam():
    eggs = 12
    return eggs
        
print spam()

#commenting
The # sign is for comments. A comment is a line of text that Python won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read.

multiline commenting 

"""Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over,
Holy Grail.
"""

#Math

You can add, subtract, multiply, divide numbers like this

addition = 72 + 23

subtraction = 108 - 204

multiplication = 108 * 0.5

division = 108 / 9

#Exponentiation

you can combine math with other data types (e.g. booleans) and commands to create useful programs. Calculators just stick to numbers.

Now let's work with exponents.

eight = 2 ** 3

#Modulo

Modulo returns the remainder from a division.

So, if you type 3 % 2, it will return 1, because 2 goes into 3 evenly once, with 1 left over.

#Strings

Another useful data type is the string. A string can contain letters, numbers, and symbols.

name = "Ryan"
age = "19"
food = "cheese"

Strings need to be within quotes.

#Escaping characters

There are some characters that cause problems. For example:

'There's a snake in my boot!'

This code breaks because Python thinks the apostrophe in 'There's' ends the string. We can use the backslash to fix the problem, like this:

'There\'s a snake in my boot!'

#Access by Index
Great work!

Each character in a string is assigned a number. This number is called the index. Check out the diagram in the editor.

c = "cats"[0]

n = "Ryan"[3]

In the above example, we create a new variable called c and set it to "c", the character at index zero of the string "cats".

Next, we create a new variable called n and set it to "n", the character at index three of the string "Ryan".

In Python, we start counting the index from zero instead of one.
